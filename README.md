# MarkTwo

_A seamless, speedy, syncing markdown editor_

MarkTwo is a free, fluid, cross-platform markdown editor and viewer ideally suited for long for documents like notes and journals. It supports most of github flavored markdown, plus extra goodies like easy emoji entry, mentions and hashtags for keeping track of the people and themes in your documents, and more. MarkTwo is a static web app backed by your own google drive - that means it's as secure as your Google account. As you can see MarkTwo is open source, so if you see something, say something! Please report bugs and request features by creating issues in this repo (there's also an in-app contact form if that's easier for you).
